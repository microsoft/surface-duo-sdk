name: publish
# This workflow (builds and) publishes the different libraries the project has.
# Publication gets triggered when a new release-tag is created (we also have manual publishing if needed).
# Every library publication has its own job, so if one fails the other can run, and we can see them all
# individually in Github Actions view.
