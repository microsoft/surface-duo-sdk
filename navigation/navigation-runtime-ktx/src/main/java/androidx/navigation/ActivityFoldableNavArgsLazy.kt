 * It is strongly recommended that this method only be used when the Activity is started
 * by [androidx.navigation.FoldableNavController.navigate] with the corresponding
 * [androidx.navigation.NavDirections] object, which ensures that the required
 * arguments are present.
 *
 * ```
 * class MyActivity : Activity() {
 *     val args: MyActivityArgs by navArgs()
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This property can be accessed only after the Activity is attached to the Application,
 * and access prior to that will result in IllegalStateException.
